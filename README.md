* A serverless API that takes in an image via a URL and outputs a modified image
* Reduces data sent to browsers and reduces the time needed to render scaled/cropped/rotated images
* Built with Javascript and the Sharp npm module
*  Deployed on AWS Lambda via Amazon API Gateway for near infinite scaling and improved performance using caching
